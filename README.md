# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description


- What was your motivation? I wanted to create a Study guide for bootcamp students to store their notes quickly and easily 
  for their prework 
- Why did you build this project? So that my notes would be in an organized place where they were easily accessed
- What problem does it solve? Quickly and efficiently finding the notes that you are looking for and providing an idea of what to study
- What did you learn? That creating a website is a lot of work and requires a lot of effort to complete, but after learning the fundamentals
  is a lot more managable and a lot of fun

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project?.
- Started by creating a Github repository and Git bash account so that i could manage my versions of the website as well as easily access
files that I wanted to pull to my environment and push to my repository
- Then I added the HTML structre so that my webpage could be formatted
- Then I added CSS to my webpage so that I could add some style to the webpage
- Then JavaScript so that my webpage could complete functions and give suggestions to potential users fo the website.
- I then created a README file so that users could learn the reason for the website and know haow to use it practically\
- and Finally I deployed it so users could access this webpage from any website, search engine, and browser.
## Usage

First open the webpage and see the heading that says the Prework study guide and a subheading that says open console to see what's happening.
Below that you'll see a list of topics covered in the Prework Study Guide such as (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.)
In those lists you will see a list of important notes over each one of those topics.
After that you will inspect the website using ctrl+shift+I on windows or command+shift+I for Mac.
Then you will open the console of the web dev tools and you'll see a list of topics and a sugesstion of what you should study.
